# Iowa Liquor Sales Analysis

This independent exploratory analysis uses public data on liquor sold in Iowa and US census population data to examine sales trends. This analysis focuses on the ten most populous Iowa counties and the time period 2018-2021.

The ten most populous Iowa counties (out of 100 total counties) comprise 52.6% of the adult (18+) population and represent 63% of the state's total liquor sales (by volume).
